# kata_query_engine
In this first version, the data is ingested into a simple index and the method of retriever is based on the input number and the choice of language. This application uses gpt-4.5-turbo as LLM. I have tested gpt 3.5 but the result is not promising. <br> <br>
The optimized data structure will be a decision tree and it will be tested in the second version.
